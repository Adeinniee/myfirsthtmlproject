    <p> Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. 
        Practices that enhance appearance include the use of <strong>cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation,</strong> fillers, <strong>laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion,</strong> peels, <strong>retinol</strong> therapy and ultrasonic skin treatment. Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of <strong>dermatitis</strong> and prevention of skin injuries.</p>
