    <h1>SKINCARE TIPS</h1>
    <div>
    Great skin is not simply a matter of DNA — your daily habits, in fact, have a big impact on what you see in the mirror. But depending on which product reviews you read or doctors you consult, there is a dizzying number of opinions on everything from how to moisturize to how to protect yourself from UV rays. Ultimately, caring for your skin is simply personal. Here’s what you should keep in mind to sort through all the noise.
    <h2 class="style">Skin Care Tips Before You Start.</h2>
    <h3 class="style">Three Main Steps</h3>
    Think of your skin-care routine as consisting of three main steps:
    
    <dl>
    <dt><span>Cleansing</span></dt>
    <dd>Washing your face.</dd>
    <dt><span>Toning</span></dt>
    <dd>Balancing the skin.</dd>
    <dt><span>Moisturizing</span></dt>
    <dd>Hydrating and softening the skin.</dd>
    <img class="image" src="../pictures/images (3).jpeg">
    <dt class="font">Applying Sunscreen</dt>
    <dd>Preventing direct exposure of the skin from UVA and UVB rays</dd>
    </dl>
    The goal of any skin-care routine is to tune up your complexion so it’s functioning at its best, and also troubleshoot or target any areas you want to work on. <em>“Beauty routines are an opportunity to notice changes within yourself,” says the San Francisco skin-care specialist Kristina Holey.</em> As your skin needs shifts with age, so will your products. <em>Still, she adds, “it’s not about creating perfection.”</em> Allow these three steps to become your daily ritual that fortifies your skin and grounds your day.
