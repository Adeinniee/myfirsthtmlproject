        <h2>Really, Are Face Masks Worth All the Hype?</h2>
        To say that face masks have become popular lately is a bit of an understatement — Sephora has more than 400 varieties (and 60 of those launched in the last few months). Masks “offer highly concentrated treatments to address specific issues,” <em>says New York City dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner.</em> But unlike a toner or a serum, masks deliver ingredients under occlusion, which helps the ingredients absorb more efficiently, notes Dr. Nazarian.
        Then there’s the fun factor: Many of the latest innovations bubble up, turn colors and peel off. Yes, it’s a little gimmicky, and this step is certainly not essential in your routine. “Think of masks like boosters — not necessary but beneficial,” <em>Mattioli says.</em>
        If you want to give one a whirl, here are three performance-driven varieties to consider, according to Mattioli:
        <br>
        <p>
        <span>Sheet masks:</span>
        <br>
        “These are primarily hydrating. Having ingredients saturated on the skin in this occlusive manner keeps air from getting in and you’ll get a higher absorption in a short amount of time. It is recommended to keep these in the fridge to get an anti-inflammatory benefit as well.”

        <br>
        <span>Sleeping packs or overnight masks:</span>
        <br>
        “Overnight masks or sleeping packs will have a thicker texture and help trap in whatever ingredients you layer underneath. They’re ideal for mature skin or severely dry skin.”

        <br>
        <span>Clay or mud masks:</span>
        <br>
        "These absorb oil and can have a mild exfoliating effect — so they’re great for oily areas. You don’t have to put it on your whole face, though. You can target just a few areas. In fact, I love multi-masking: using a clay on the t-zone and a hydrating one everywhere else.”

        </p>
        <p><em>Insider tip:</em> Apply masks after serum but before moisturizer, unless it’s a leave-on overnight mask, which can take the place of your nighttime moisturizer. Like any product that supplements your regular routine, masks should be used in moderation — no more than once a week to prevent any irritation, <em>Dr.  Zeichner says.</em>
