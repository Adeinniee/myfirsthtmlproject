        Skin <em>toner</em> or simply <em>toner</em> refers to a lotion or wash designed to cleanse the skin and shrink the appearance of <em>pores</em>, usually used on the face. It also moisturizes, protects and refreshes the skin. Although the toner has a water-like structure and looks like it, it is more than just a simple combination of hydrogen and oxygen.

    In the past, toner was deemed unnecessary, too astringent, and incredibly drying, all of which are definitely not conducive to a radiant and healthy complexion. These days, toners do just the opposite. <em>"They used to contain high concentrations of alcohol to help remove oil from the skin," Joshua Zeichner,</em> the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. "The newest generation of toners, however, have more than astringent properties, and many of them are alcohol-free. Currently, there are toners on the market to address almost every skin concern and are no longer limited to treating acne and oily skin."
    It brings your skin back to its natural acidic state, sweeping impurities away and helping your skin absorb your skincare products. 
    
    <h2>When should I use it?</h2>
    The short answer is "it goes after cleansing," according to Amy Wechsler, a dermatologist based in New York City. She recommends including toner in both your <em>day and night skin-care routines.</em> To get more specific, you should use toner after you double cleanse and exfoliate your skin, both Cho and Chang agree. "A thorough cleanse helps to 'clear away' grime, makeup, dead skin cells so that the skin-beneficial ingredients in the toner can get where they need to," Chang explains.
    Oh yeah, and you should use a toner no later than a minute after cleansing. I know that sounds crazy, but it seriously helps. "Most molecules penetrate the skin better when it is wet, so applying active ingredients immediately after cleansing delivers better results," Kauvar explains.
