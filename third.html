    <p>Sunscreen is a step in daily skin care that is often overlooked, yet is one of the most important. Whether or not the sun is blazing, UV rays are prevalent. Prolonged exposure to UV rays can be damaging and even dangerous to the skin, leading to premature lines and wrinkles, sun spots, and even more dangerous illnesses. A simple step to preserve the health of your skin would be to add in a daily sunscreen. There are not many formulations that are made specifically for the face; they should be lightweight and easily blendable with foundation or other face makeup.

      <em>There’s no need to worry if you feel overwhelmed by the world of skincare. While some of the extras, like serums and toners, can be great additions to your routines when used properly, the top three 
necessities are a cleanser, a moisturizer and a sunscreen. You don’t need expensive items or a long list of products to have 
healthy and clear skin. Focus instead on consistency and solid ingredients that work well for your skin type.
